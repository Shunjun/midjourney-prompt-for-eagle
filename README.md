Add prompt on image annotation when using Eagle to collect images on www.midjourney.com

## Usage

1. Drag the image to the Eagle floating window

2. ~~Use the batch collection function to save images~~
   Currently, the batch collection will only save the image ID as the image's title. This might be a bug in Eagle. We'll see about it later.
